# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide assists beginners in web wevelopment in understanding the basic topics. 
I build this project as an intro into web development. It not only aids my understanding but it also gives me a chance to apply what I learn. 
This project helps remove some of the uncertainty surrounding web development. A lot of people do not know where to begin when wanting to create their own websites, so the Prework Study Guide gives people a good place to start. 

## Installation

## Usage

An HTML file controls the content displayed on a webpage, CSS helps style that content, and Javascript helps add function to it. 
Git acts as a local repository while Github acts as a remote repository. This enables me to code locally on Git, then add my changes to the remote repository to check their validity then save them. Incrementally adding pieces of code to a project allows for version control, which makes it easier to debug in case there was an error, because I can then access a previous version of my code and figure our where I went wrong.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
